I need you to build a simple video uploading webpage to upload a video to 3 sites - Bitchute.com , Rumble.com and Odysee.com by one-click, at the same time.
Required fields are Title, Description, Thumbnail photo file upload button, Video file upload button and Submit button.
This is a web app used by me personally.
The sites mostly don't support their Rest API, so recommend you to use an automation library or something else.
Make sure the bot remembers the TITLE AND DESCRIPTION and saves the last entry. So when i open bot again or if i want to re upload same video, it will be populated in the fields before i start

Make sure on the upload page on bottom there are 3 check boxes. 1 check box is Bitchute - 2nd check box is Rumble and 3rd check box is Odysee.

No user dashboard, No professional design, No additional requirements.
